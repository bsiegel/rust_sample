# Rust Book Club - sample project

In this example, we decided to begin by implementing the basic skeleton
of a linked list data structure. We will fill in functionality as we
move forward.

This sample may incorporate functionality that hasn't yet been covered
in our book club, but we'll do our best to read up on / explain the
functionality as we move ahead.
